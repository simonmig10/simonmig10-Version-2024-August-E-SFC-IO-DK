# Empirical Ecological Stock-Flow-Consistent Input-Output model for the Danish economy

This repository contains the replication material for the model simulations presented in the working paper "A Benchmark Ecological Stock-Flow-Consistent Input-Output Model for Denmark." The following materials are included:

- Model Data: This folder contains the cleaned dataset necessary to run the model. Data cleaning scripts can be shared upon request.
- Model Code: A text file with all the model equations, written using the BIMETS syntax.
- Model Simulations: An R Markdown file (.Rmd) that runs the baseline model and executes the three shocks as introduced in the working paper.
